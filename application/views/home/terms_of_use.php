It must not be altered in any way, such as in layout, shape, font, font style, position or color. (<a class="" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1BuDAuN0r8SeDZnZ1BiZkF0dUE">See PUP Logo Specification for more information</a>)</p>
                            <p>When written permission to reproduce materials is granted, PUP should be acknowledged as the source of the materials.</p>
                            <p>If any component of the Service or any of its components are marked “Preview”, "Pre-released", "Beta", "Currently being updated", "To be Updated" or "Under Construction", that component constitutes pre-release Information and may be changed substantially before its formal release. You have the option not to use that Service in a live operating environment where it may be relied upon to perform in the same manner as a formally released component or with data that has not been sufficiently backed up.</p>
                            <h3 class="mb-3 text-primary">No Unlawful or Prohibited Use of the Services</h3>
                            <p>As a condition of your use of the Services, you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms, conditions, and notices. You may not use the Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair any PUP server, or the network(s) connected to any PUP server, or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of any Services. You must not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any Services, other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to any PUP server or to any of the Services, through hacking, password mining or any other means.

                            <h3 class="mb-3 text-primary">Use of Services</h3>
                            <p>The Services may contain e-mail features, forum and bulletin board, messaging, virtual communities, portals, calendars, media galleries, social media channels, document and communication management systems, and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with others (each referred to as "Communication Service" and collectively as "Communication Services"). You agree to use the Communication Services only to post, send and receive messages and material that are proper and, when applicable, related to the particular Communication Service.</p>
                            <p>The University adheres to the basic principles of human decency, respect and values. We have zero tolerance for messages and comments that curse, trash, degrade, humiliate and intimidate. Such behavior does little to inspire intelligent and educated discussion. Freedom of speech does not mean license to smear reputation and ruin credibility. Nor does it mean the freedom to be irresponsible and to defame. Freedom of speech, rather, is the recognition of the right of anyone to speak his or her mind, and to express a contrary view without being objectionable.</p>
                            <p>By way of example, and not limited to the following, you agree that when you use the Communication Services, you will NOT:</p>
                            <ul class="mx-4">
                              <li> Use the Communication Services in connection with surveys, contests, pyramid schemes, chain letters, junk email, spamming or any duplicative or unsolicited messages (commercial or otherwise);</li>
                              <li> Defame, abuse, harass, insult, curse, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others;</li>
                              <li> Disrespect the views of others. Some topics that are posted might be controversial or offensive to the sensibilities of some. If you feel strongly against such topics, you can practice courteous responses or report the concerned post to the Service Administrator. We don't want any mudslinging and flaming going on in the Services as it affects everyone;</li>
                              <li> Publish, post, disclose, upload, distribute or disseminate any inappropriate, political, profane, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, inaccurate, harassing, hateful, threatening, indecent or unlawful topic, name, material or information;</li>
                              <li> Upload, or otherwise make available, files or documents that contain images, photographs, software or other material protected by intellectual property laws, including, by way of example, and not limited to, copyright or trademark laws (or by rights of privacy or publicity) unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consent to do the same;</li>
                              <li> Use any material or information, including images or photographs, which are made available through the Services in any manner that infringes any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary right of any party;</li>

                              <li> Type LYk DiS and refrain frm usng 2 mch encryptd txt shrtcts. That way, everyone will have an easier time reading the information;</li>
                              <li> Type in ALL CAPS or CAPITAL LETTERS throughout your content. It gives others the wrong impression that you are shouting;</li>
                              <li> Flood posts as it will cause everyone to suffer in terms of the site performance. Flooders who posts nonsense messages could very well get their accounts banned. Also, avoid using extensive uses of line spacing. We will consider this as flooding;</li>
                              <li> Upload unnecessarily large images because it will ruin the layout of the Service and slow down the loading of pages for other users. Be considerate of other's bandwidth as most are still using slow Internet connection;</li>
                              <li> Post personal information (personal email, mobile number, landline number, etc.) of anyone. Doing so might leave the victim open to harassment. Let us respect the privacy of others; and</li>
