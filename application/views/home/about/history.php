                  <p class="text-justify">The PUP Quezon City Branch, formerly PUP Commonwealth Campus, was established through the generosity and benevolence of Mr. Walter Rothlehner, a German church leader and owner of a square building situated at SIKHAY Compound, Don Fabian St., Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City. It was donated to the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) by Mr. Rothlehner.
                    Later on, the 1.9 hectares of land was also donated to PUP by the SIKHAY â€“ an association duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) represented by its President, Rev. Fr. Joel E. Tabora, S.J. 
                    PUP Quezon City started as a two-building campus. These two buildings were donated purposively used as classrooms, libraries, and offices for students and faculty members.
                    Hence through its Open University System, PUP committed to administer and maintain the described buildings and portion of land in the interest of its students in the locality and nearby vicinity.
