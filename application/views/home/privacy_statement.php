                            <p>
                              PUP uses the data we collect for three (3) fundamental purposes:
                            </p>
                            <div class="my-3">

                                <li> To operate as a higher education institution (HEI) and provide (including improving and customizing) the services we offer,</li>
                                <li> To send communication, including informative communication, and</li>

                            <p>
                              In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect to give you a more seamless, consistent and customized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have safety measures designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, when you are not yet authenticated (or not signed in), we store data we collect from you separately from any account information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or contact number).

This includes operating the Services, maintaining and improving the performance of the Services, including developing new features, research, and providing technical support. Examples of such uses include the following.

Furthermore, you can sign up for email subscriptions from the University's official social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.) and choose whether you wish to receive communications from PUP's social media channels.

In some instances, because the University uses third-party technologies to provide services on our behalf, such as online storage, webmail and site analytics. In other instances, it is because our Services contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks.

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential data (such as your name or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="mb-3 text-primary">Location where your Personal Data is Stored and Processed</h3>

Office 365 maintains data centers in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia. Typically, the primary storage location of your personal data is in the Philippines, often with a backup to a data center in another region. The storage location(s) are chosen by Office 365 in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem. We ensure that the data we collect via the Services are processed according to the provisions of this privacy statement and the requirements of applicable law.

                              The University retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested or may request in the future, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our commitments, legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly. The criteria used to determine the retention periods include:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="mx-4">
                              <li><span class="fw-medium"> How long is the personal data needed to provide the services operated by the University?</span> This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of those services, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate academic, student, and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.</li>
                              <li><span class="fw-medium"> Do users provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?</span> Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Office 365 Outlook inbox, or attachments made during online registration or reporting. In such cases, PUP and/or the third-party provider maintains the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Office 365 Outlook inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in their system for up to 30 days before final deletion).</li>
                              <li><span class="fw-medium"> Is PUP subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data?</span> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the Philippines (or applicable jurisdiction for third-party providers), Government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of due process.</li>
                            </ul>
