                            PUPQC was established through the generosity and benevolence of Walter Rothlehner, a German church leader who donated his property in Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City to PUP.

The PUP Open University was tasked to administer and maintain the campus and its facilities. PUPQC was formally inaugurated on July 29, 1997. Although it was in existing prior to 1997, it only started its operations and formal classes after its inauguration.
