                            <p>
                              myPUPQC is the official website and portal of the Polytechnic University of the Phillipines - Quezon City Branch.
                              It serve as an effective medium to reach out to an interconnected world, giving the online 
                              community better access to University information, activities, news and insights.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              We never expect that myPUPQC would go on a long way since it only started as a college capstone project.
                              It has been an experience getting this site into what it is today and we want to share those experiences with you,
                              so perhaps you'll be able to apply them as you build and manage your own website.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              When the myPUPQC project intially launched in 2022, it was designed to display basic
                              information about the University. The site was then hosted via Name.com. As the site took 
                              of in February 2022, more and more responses and requests began filling its online guestbook.
                              In the later months, a number of pages containing relevant information about the University were added.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Today, myPUPQC continues to evolve dramatically as it gives its visitors information that is
                              relevant and useful to them and the website and its social network channels has matured into 
                              one of the University's most important medium for information dissemination. Our visitors
                              send us feedback through email or website survey. That information helps us focus on what
                              content and features to further develop for an improved myPUPQC experience.

                              The name is stylized as "myPUPQC" in reference to my.harvard, Harvard University's Student, Teaching, Advising, or Administrative Portal. It was also a reference to myUSTe, 
                              University of Santo Tomas' version of Student Self-Service Portal. This website idea took primarily in ideas of those systems thus in the succeeding updates, we want to cater 
                              this system to everyone in PUP Quezon City

                              myPUPQC is so far the best online presentation of the Universities of all branches branding and service offerings.
                              You will notice a modern and profeesional design with functionality, ease-of-use, accessibility, and service in mind,
                              with focus on the clients of the University. It is built using the latest Web Standards (HTML5, CSS3) and applies a Responsive Web Design (RWD)
